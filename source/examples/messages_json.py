		"message": "Hi Tom, thanks for taking the time to meet with me today. I’ve been looking into solar solutions, and I’m particularly interested in a solar roof for my home. By the way, I love Beethoven."
	},
	{
		"speaker": "Tom",
		"message": "Absolutely, Jerry. I’m glad you reached out. Let’s start with what’s driving your interest in a solar roof—are you primarily focused on lowering your energy bills, reducing your carbon footprint, or both?"
	},
	{
		"speaker": "Jerry",
		"message": "A bit of both, actually. I’ve read that solar roofs can generate enough electricity to cover most of a household’s needs, and I want to take advantage of that. Plus, I don’t want to worry about noisy panels sticking up on my shingles—I like the sleek look of an integrated solar roof."
	},
	{
		"speaker": "Tom",
		"message": "That makes sense. Our solar roofs use high-efficiency photovoltaic tiles that look just like traditional roofing materials, so there’s no bulky rack-mounted system. They blend in seamlessly, and they’re backed by a 25-year warranty for both power output and weatherproofing."
	},
	{
		"speaker": "Jerry",
		"message": "That warranty sounds reassuring. Can you tell me more about the tile efficiency and overall expected output?"
	},
	{
		"speaker": "Tom",
		"message": "Of course. Each solar tile has an efficiency of about 22–23%, which is on par with top-tier solar panels. For an average 2,000 ft² roof in Berlin receiving roughly 1,000 kWh/m²/year of solar irradiance, you can expect around 5,000 kWh of annual generation. That typically covers 80–90% of a household’s consumption, depending on your usage patterns."
